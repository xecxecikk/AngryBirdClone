# SpriteKit Game (Angry Bird)

This is a simple 2D game developed using Apple's SpriteKit framework. The game features a bird character that interacts with boxes in the game scene. The player controls the bird by touching and dragging it, causing it to apply impulse and interact with the boxes.

## Features
- **Bird Movement**: The player can drag and release the bird to apply impulse and make it move.
- **Boxes**: When the bird collides with the boxes, they move with applied physics.
- **Score System**: The player earns points when the bird collides with boxes. The score increases with each collision.
- **Physics-Based**: The game uses physics for both the bird and the boxes to create a dynamic environment.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SpriteKit**: The 2D game engine used for building the game.
- **Swift**: A modern programming language used for building iOS and macOS applications.
- **Xcode**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for iOS and macOS app development.
- **Git**: A distributed version control system used to manage the project's source code.
